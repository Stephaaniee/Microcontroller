**Give a schematic overview on the main elements of a microcontroller.**

**Which processors are typically used for microcontrollers?  Given an overview of the characteristics (like: #address bits, cpu frequency, # memory, …)**

**Implement a 2-bit (branch) predictor given by the state diagram in the lecture  In C-Code  As a circuit (use the known memory elements from computer science 1)**
**The company KOA tries to develop a tool for anothercompany. The tool should support business processes. The team of KOA applies the waterfall model. 
a) Name all phases, which are applied during the development and specify (1 2 sentences) the result of each phase. 
As the waterfall model is to restrict, the team of KOA tries to update the process to the V Model. b) Name the additional phases of the V Model and argue 
the pros**

**Implement the 2-bit predictor (exercise 3) with the help of interrupts. 
The interrupts are used for considering the events (e.g. switching from state 00 to state 01 via receiving the interrupt event “taken”)**
