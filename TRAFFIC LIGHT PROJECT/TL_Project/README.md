**TL01**
**First scenario
 One line and one traffic light
 Control the lights with respect to timing
Model the traffic light system with the following diagram
 Structure: a class diagram that represents the main structural elements
Develop a realistic traffic light control system.
 Use leds as traffic light
 Use an Arduino as μC
 Map the state machine model to code (via switch state pattern)
**

**TL02**
**Extend the (car) traffic light system of the first sprint by a pedestrian light
 Extend a button for the pedestrian. If pressed, the pedestrian lights switches as fast as possible to
green.
 Guarantee that
 The pedestrian lights signal is red if the traffic light signal is green
 If the pedestrian lights signal is green the traffic light is red
 At least the green traffic light is required to stay for 10 time units in green and 5 time units in yellow.
Model your solution
 Extend the class diagram
 Extend the tinkercad simulation by;
 A pedestrian button
 Green and red light for the pedestrian light.
**

**Realize the pedestrian light in concurrent to the traffic
light
 Update your solution on model level in form of using concurrent
regions
